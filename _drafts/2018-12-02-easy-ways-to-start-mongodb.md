# 5 Easy Ways To Get Started With MongoDB

I was proud of myself when I earned the MongoDB developer certification within few months after getting into MongoDB. Given my track record of zero certifications, this really was something to be proud of. Of course, a certification may not interest you based on your personal learning methods. But If you're looking forward to learn MongoDB, then here are some easy ways that can helped you:

## Online Training
[MongoDB university's][1] is the best place to start your MongoDB journey. They offer a variety of free courses focussing on different roles of a MongoDB specialist - developer, admin, cluster managament etc. These courses are designed to help you learn both theory and practicals. To make the most out of it, play around with the practical examples provided. The class helps you enough with each practical examples so you can experiment on your own. By just investing 3-4hrs a week for few weeks you will be well on your way in becoming a MongoDB lover. By taking this as a first step you can build a good foundation which will you help in the other 4 ways of learning described further below.

## Official Documentation
[MongoDB's official documentation][2] is excellent in clarity! Most concepts are accompanied by practical examples. You should have no problem becoming a MongoDB expert just by learning through the docs in the same order they are organized. If you have any prior experience with databases, you will find it easier to get up to speed with MongoDB by just reading the documentation. If you don't, I would suggest to take a course from the MongoDB university first and then dive into the docs. This will help establish a solid context for you.

## MongoDB Presentations
The [MongoDB resource center][3] provides a variety of knowledge materials to learn from. Presentations are one of them and they're created by experts who have very good knowledge on databases. Although not all the presentations are meant to get us started, few keywords like [introduction][4], [back to basics][5] can point us to several helpful introductory presentations. They not only explain how to accomplish certain things in MongoDB, but also why MongoDB does what it does.

## MongoDB Certification Study Guide
[MongoDB's certification program][6] comes with an exceptional study guide. It points to all the key concepts of MongoDB and references to documentations, presentations and white papers. But it's available only when you pay
for the exam. Registering for an exam well in advance and using the study guide for preparation is the easiest path you can take to become a MongoDB expert. Kudos to the team who created the study guide! If you find the exam fee to be expensive, you can earn points in [MongoDB's Advocacy Hub][7] and claim a certification exam as a reward.

## Stackoverflow
Stackoverflow can help us in learning any technology, not just MongoDB. Here's how I use it for learning MongoDB:

- _Search for questions [tagged with mongodb][8]_.
- _Look for a question that I feel I can answer._
This is tricky, but you will get the hang of it after trying it few times. The goal is spot a question that requires only MongoDB knowledge to answer. If you're not able to spot them so easily, just pick random ones.
- _Attempt to answer the question without looking at the existing answers_. Just don't post it if it's same as the already posted answer.

If you don't answer a question just because it's already answered, then you're losing a valuable opportunity to learn something. This method will definitely push you to learn and discover MongoDB more. It has other benefits too. If you are absolutely stuck even after doing your best, you can always use the existing answer to fill your knowledge gap. And if there's already an answer, then you can be almost certain that the question is valid and consistent. So you need not wonder whether the question is answerable in the first place. By first working on your own and then relying on external resources to help fill the gap, you're doing a great favor to yourself because you're actively engaging yourself in learning instead of passively reading through the answer. That's why this is my favorite method to learn, not just MongoDB. :)


Hope these methods help you as much as it helped me. Thanks for reading!
