# 5 Easy Ways To Get Started With MongoDB

I was proud of myself when I earned the MongoDB developer certification within few months after getting into MongoDB. Given my track record of zero certifications, this really was something to be proud of. Of course, a certification may not interest you based on your personal learning methods. But If you're looking forward to learn MongoDB, then here are some easy ways that helped me get started:

## Online Training
[MongoDB university's][1] is the best place to start your MongoDB journey. They offer a variety of free courses focussing on different roles of a MongoDB specialist - developer, admin, cluster managament etc. These courses are designed to help you learn both theory and practicals. To make the most out of it, play around with the practical examples provided. The class helps you enough with each practical examples so you can experiment on your own. By just investing 3-4hrs a week for few weeks you will be well on your way in becoming a MongoDB lover.

## Official Documentation
MongoDB's official documentation is excellent! Most concepts are accompanied by practical examples. You should have no problem becoming a MongoDB expert just by learning through the docs in the same order they are organized. If you have any prior experience with databases, then you should have no problem getting up to speed with MongoDB by just reading the documentation. If you're not, I would suggest to take a course from the MongoDB university first and then dive into the docs. This will help establish a solid context for you when you're learning from the docs.
